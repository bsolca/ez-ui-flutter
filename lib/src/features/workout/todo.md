# Workout feature Steps

### 1. Database Setup and Schema Design
- **Define Schema**: Set up tables or collections for `WorkoutModel`, `WorkoutStepModel`, `WorkoutExerciseModel`, and `ExerciseModel`, ensuring relationships align with the ID references in each model.
- **Data Indexing**: For efficient querying, index commonly searched fields like `id`, `name`, `tags`, `stepIds`, `workoutExerciseIds`, and `exerciseId`.

### 2. Repository Layer Implementation
- **Create Repositories**: Implement repositories for each model to handle CRUD operations. These repositories would abstract database interactions, making it easier to perform operations like fetching workouts, steps, or exercises by ID.
- **Batch Retrieval Logic**: When loading a workout, add logic to retrieve all referenced steps and exercises by ID, reconstructing the full workout from linked entities.

### 3. Service Layer for Workout Building and Editing
- **Workout Assembly**: Create services that assemble a complete workout by fetching and combining data from all referenced models.
- **Workout Editing**: Implement functionality to edit workouts by adding/removing steps or exercises and updating model references accordingly.
- **Validation**: Add validation for models, such as ensuring each `stepId` in `WorkoutModel` exists in `WorkoutStepModel` or checking `exerciseId` references in `WorkoutExerciseModel`.

### 4. User Interface Development
- **Workout Creation UI**: Build the workout creation interface based on the features you've outlined, such as adding steps, configuring exercises, and setting details.
- **Workout Preview and Editing UI**: Create UI components to preview a complete workout and allow for quick edits (e.g., changing exercise order, modifying step details).
- **Linking with Repositories**: Connect the UI to repositories so data flows smoothly from the UI to the database and vice versa.

### 5. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test each modelâ€™s JSON serialization/deserialization to ensure data integrity.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the repository layer to verify that it correctly retrieves and saves interconnected models in the database.
- **UI and Service Tests**: Ensure the workout builder and editor function smoothly, linking steps and exercises as expected.

### 6. Advanced Features and Optimizations
- **Caching Layer**: Add caching for frequently accessed exercises or workouts to improve performance.
- **Workout Templates and Duplication**: Allow users to duplicate workouts as templates, making it easy to create similar workouts quickly.
- **User-Specific Customization**: Implement user-based data handling, such as saving workouts per user or providing user-specific workout histories.
