Ensures maintainability, scalability, and abstraction for easy updates and customizations.

### C.4 Domain-Driven Design

The application follows Domain-Driven Design principles, structuring the app around distinct domains that reflect real-world scenarios. This approach enables better organization and scalability of the codebase.

#### C.4.1 Example Domains

- **User Management Domain:** Handles authentication, roles, and permissions for coaches and athletes.
- **Subscription and Payment Domain:** Manages subscription processes, payment validation, and different access tiers for athletes.

By dividing the project into clear domains, each part of the app is easier to understand, develop, and maintain, reducing complexity and dependencies across the system.

### C.5 Feature-First Approach

The project is organized with a feature-first folder structure.

#### C.5.1 Folder Structure

- **Presentation Files:** Contains main widgets and controllers.
- **Widgets Folder:** Includes all reusable widgets for the feature.
- **Data Folder:** Manages data-related operations.
- **Service Folder:** Contains business logic service classes.

- **Exercise Library:** Coaches can upload exercise videos or use existing ones, categorize them, and add descriptions and instructions.
- **Athlete Assignment:** Coaches can assign created programs to athletes and set schedules for workouts.
- **Progress Tracking:** Coaches can track athlete progress by viewing logged workouts and adding notes or feedback.

#### F.1.2 Athlete Module

- **Athlete Registration and Profile Setup:** Athletes can register, set up their profile, and provide information such as fitness goals, experience level, and any medical conditions.
- **Program View and Follow:** Athletes can view assigned workout programs, mark exercises as complete, and log their progress (e.g., weights lifted, reps completed).
- **Workout Logging:** Athletes can log their workouts and add personal notes, such as how they felt during the exercise or any issues encountered.
- **Progress Overview:** Athletes can view their progress over time, including workout history and any feedback provided by the coach.
